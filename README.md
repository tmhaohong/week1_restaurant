## Notes

I met some issues:
- I don't know how to config the router to make AJAX works.
- I don't know how to vailate the input in backend
- I don't understand how to link table to table
- I don't understand the router file clearly enough
- I don't know how to make JS runs, I need to refresh page to make it works. I will meet errors if I put something in coffee script files
